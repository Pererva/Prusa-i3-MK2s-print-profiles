# YOYI PETG

## Tested products
- PETG001-Transp Red : 1.75 mm, Semi-transparent Red

## Found problems:
- Self-dripping from nozzle when heated (very liquid)
- Terrible first layer adhesion (solvable)

## First layer adhesion solution
### 1. Polyimide Tape (works the best for me)
While bed is still cold:
- clean the surface
- apply the polyimide tape
- prints

This tape is usually used by electronics hobbyists to isolate conductive parts, which can self-heat. Material is also known as capron.

### 3. Hair Spray (for now - not tested)
Apply when bed is not heated:
- clean the surface with isopropyl alcohol to remove any residual from previous prints
- Cover with 1-2 uniform layers of spray
- print with brims

### 2. Glue stick (tested, works terribly)
Apply when bed is not heated:
- clean the surface with isopropyl alcohol to remove any residual from previous prints
- treat the surface with glue stick (very thin layer)
- print with brims

## Post-print cleaning of bed
- let it cool down and clean with isopropyl alcohol
